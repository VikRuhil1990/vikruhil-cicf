1. Get more familar with Git
1. Create a GitHub account
1. Make changes to a Git repo and push changes for others

It is hard to overstate the importance and usefulness of Git in modern software development.
However, the user interface leaves a lot to be desired.

- Software Carpentry's [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
- There are many Git hosting sites, these are the big three: [Github](https://github.com), [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
- Git is by far the most used version control system, but it isn't the only one: [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), [Fossil](https://www2.fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki), [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/), [CVS]
CVS (ancient, old, please never use)
- [The Biggest and Weirdest Commits in Linux Kernel Git History](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/blog/2017/the-biggest-and-weirdest-commits-in-linux-kernel-git-history) (2017)

Developers love to design algorithmsâ€”including ways that people should organize software development with Git.
- [Git Workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
- [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
- [Github flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)
- There are too many to name. Organizational needs are important, since open source software is developed differently than closed source, and mobile apps are different than webapps. (e.g. Webapps can deploy a new version continuously unlike mobile apps). Scientific software is likewise different since it is usually for a specific purpose. 
- [Example](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-formal-models/pull/29) of a GitHub Pull Request and comments

Issue tracking is basically a big list but with ability to sort based on metadata.

- [Github Issue tracker](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues)
- The big professional grade tracker is Jira, but it is expensive.
- [An epic treatise on scheduling, bug tracking, and triage](https://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201712)

Testing is a huge area to learn about.

- [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contents.html) package
- [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). Developers love to create methodologies.
- [Checking in on the state of TDD](https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2023/07/12/checking-in-on-the-state-of-tdd/) (2023-07-12)
- [Types of tests](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/types-of-software-testing)

- [Model Checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking) can verify correctness of programs to a specification. In this way it is the other side of the coin from testing. They are based on [temporal logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_tree_logic). One example of a model checker is [TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html).
