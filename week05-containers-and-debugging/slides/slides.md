# Welcome to week five of CICF!

## The plan this week

We will go over two different topics: containers and debugging

::: {.notes}

They are different topics. There could be some unifying thing there,
such as debugging containers or debugging inside containers, but we
are not there yet.  We are discussing them together only because we
could not dedicate more time to each of them. They are both important
topics.

By necessity, we will keep things short and simple, and gloss over
some things.  You should explore things on your own, and go after
things that really interest you.

:::

# Containers

## The packaging problem

## A word about versioning

## Containers and virtual machines

You can run a container inside a virtual machine but can you run a
virtual machine inside a container?


# Debugging

## What is a bug?

<!-- TODO: Grace hopper and the bug -->

## pdb

## trace

## etc.
