CADDY_USERNAME='cicf'

# Caddy can only use hashed passwords, and not plain text passwords.
# Using `caddy hash-password` is the convenient way to hash a
# password.  Run the below command:
#
#  docker run caddy caddy hash-password -p '<YOUR-PASSWORD>'
#
# and paste the result below, betweem the single quotes, to set a
# password.  The single quotes are important -- do not omit them.
