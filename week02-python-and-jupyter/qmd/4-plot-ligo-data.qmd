title: Plot LIGO data
jupyter: python3
---



You should have downloaded a file named `H-H2_LOSC_4_V1-815235072-4096.hdf5` from LIGO, following the README of this week.  Let open this file using the h5py library that we had installed earlier and explore the data in the file.

```{python}
import h5py
data = h5py.File('H-H2_LOSC_4_V1-815235072-4096.hdf5', 'r')
```

We can look at the dataset:

```{python}
for k in data.keys():
    print(k)
```

And:

```{python}
for k,v in data['meta'].items():
    print(k,v)
```

That is not quite what we want:

```{python}
for k,v in data['meta'].items():
    print(k,v[...])
```

Let us load some of the data into an array, and plot the array using matplotlib:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

strain = data['strain']['Strain']
N = 5000
plt.plot(range(N), strain[:N])
```
