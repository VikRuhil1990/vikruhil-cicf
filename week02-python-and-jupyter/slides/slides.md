# Welcome to week two of CICF!

## The plan this week:

We have four Jupyter notebooks in the tutorials this week. They will
give you:

- A quick tour of Jupyter notebooks.
- A quick tour of Python programming language.
- A quick overview of Python packages.
- A quick example of working with some LIGO data in Jupyter.

By necessity, we will keep things short and simple, and gloss over
some things.

# Jupyter notebooks

## What are Jupyter notebooks?  Why are they useful?

- Jupyter notebooks are a way to write text/documentation, code,
  equations, data, graphs, images, etc. together.
- You can view and edit these notebooks in a web browser window.
- You can execute code in these notebooks from the web browser window.
- You can share these notebooks with other people.

They are kind of like paper lab notebooks, but in a browser window.

- [Microsoft Planetary
  Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/)
- [FABRIC project's JupyterLab
instance](https://jupyter.fabric-testbed.net/)
- [Chameleon project's JupyterLab
instance](https://jupyter.chameleoncloud.org/)
- etc.

## Also!

- You can set up an IDE (such as VS Code or Codium) to work with
  notebooks.
- Preview notebooks from GitHub.com, sometimes.
- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) has support for
  notebooks.


# Python

## First, a Word about Python

We will not attempt to teach you Python this week. But!

If you know any other programming language, you can learn Python on
your own very quickly.  Find a resource that suits your learning
style.

Two ways:

- Use a Jupyter notebook, write code in new cells, and run them.
- Use the Python REPL ("Read-Eval-Print Loop")

You can also write little scripts using an editor or IDE and run them.
REPL or notebook should be good enough to test things out.

## Variables

Variables are like you expect, except, unlike Java or C++, the are not
"strongly" typed.

A variable can be a number one moment and then can suddenly become a
string:

```python
>>> amount = 7
>>> amount
7
>>> amount = "a whole lot!"
>>> amount
a whole lot!
```

## Statements

TODO

## Flow of control

You have `if`, `if`/`else`, `for`, `while`, etc.

## Example

Here's a `for` loop inside of an `if` statement:

```python
if temperature >= 100:
    print("It boiled!")
    for sample_tube in range(1, 6):
        print("concentration is: ", tube_concentration[sample_tube])
else:
    print("Warmed up, but not boiling yet. Try harder.")
```
  
Notice colons at the ends of the `if`, `for`, and `else` statements.  

## Code layout has meaning

- Code blocks are indicated by indentation level
  - In comparison C, C++ and Java begin blocks with `{` and end them
    with `}`.
- Indentation of a code block MUST be the same for the entire block. 
- Best Practice: indent with four spaces.
- Do not use tab characters unless you're certain that your editor
  will turn `<tab>` keys into spaces.


## Basic data types

- Booleans (`True` and `False`)
- Numbers
  - Integers (example: `-1`, `0`, `1`, `2`, â€¦)
  - Floating point numbers (example: `3.14`)
- Strings (example: `"hello world!"`)

## Built-in data structures

- Lists 
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Sets

## Lists

Python lists are like arrays in C++ and Java, except:

- They can grow (and shrink) as needed.
- The different elements of an array don't all have to be the same
  type.

Lists are one-dimensional. If you would normally use a 2D array for
something, you would want to use a list of lists.

## List example

```python
>>> temperatures = [44.2, 43.6, 107.9, "awfully hot!"]
>>> temperatures[3]
awfully hot!
```

## Another list example

```python
>>> grades = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "F"]
>>> len(grades)
5
>>> grades[0]
A
>>> grades[4]
F
>>> grades[5]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
```

Notice the first element in a list is numbered 0 (zero).  

Any time you index into a list, Python always counts starting at 0,
not 1. Forgetting this will likely be a big source of mistakes.

## Strings

Strings can be surrounded by single quotes (`'`) or double quotes
(`"`). Whichever one you start a string with, you have to end with
that same kind.

```python
>>> 'hello' == "hello"
True
>>> 'hello"
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    'hello"
    ^
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)
```

## Slicing strings and lists

Python strings _act_ just like lists of letters.

Here's some useful syntax for selecting just part of a string:

```python
>>> st = "ABCDEFG"
>>> st[2:4]
CD
>>> st[4:]
EFG
>>> st[:2]
AB
>>> st[0:6:2]
'ACE'
```

This operation is called "slicing", and has the syntax
`object[start:end:step]`.

Slicing will also work on lists.


## Dictionaries

Dictionaries (or `dict` objects in Python parlance) contain pairs of
keys and values:

```python
>>> drugs = { 
...    "asprin": 325, 
...    "acetaminophen": 500 
... }
>>> 
>>> drugs["asprin"]
325
>>> drugs["acetaminophen"]
500
>>> drugs["ibuprofen"]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'ibuprofen'
```

## Operators

- All the usual ones:  `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Integer division:   `7 // 2`   yields `3`
- Remainder:    `7 % 2`   yields `1`
- Exponentiation: `2 ** 8`  yields `256`

- Operators can be overloaded: they can have different meanings
depending on the data type.

- The plus sign will concatenate strings: `"Hi there, " + 'human'`
yields the single string `"Hi there, human"`

## Functions

- Lots of built-in functions (`print()`, `range()`, etc.)
- Easy to create your own:

```python
import math  # use Python's math module.

def area_of_circle(radius):
    """
    Compute area of a circle.

    :param radius: radius of the circle.
    """
    result = math.pi * radius ** 2
    return result
```

We have also sneakily introduced usage of modules and comment syntax
here!

## Calling a function

You would call a function like so:

```python
>>> area_of_circle(10)
314.1592653589793
>>> area_of_circle(5)
78.53981633974483
```

## User defined classes

Python classes can't be too strange to those familiar with C++ or
Java:

```python
class Customer:
    """
    A class to represent a customer
    """
    def __init__(self, name, address):
        """ Constructor """
        self.name = name
        self.address = address

    def show(self):
        """ Print customer details """
        print(self.name + " lives at " + self.address)
```

You would use them like so:

```python
>>> c = Customer("Bob", "1234 Wooded Way")
>>> c.show()
Bob lives at 1234 Wooded Way
```


## Error handling with exceptions

When an unrecoverable error occurs, the Python runtime "throws" an
exception that is "caught" by an exception handler.

```python
try:
  individual_portion = total_grams / number_of_people
except:
  print("Number of people was zero, no valid answer!")
```

If you do not catch an exception, your program will fail with an error
message.

## Modules

- Modules are _organizational units_ of a Python program.  When you
create a Python project, you would split your code into logical units,
called _modules_.

- In concrete terms, modules correspond to files.

```
mypackage/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
    subpackage/
        __init__.py
        submodule1.py
```

## Using modules

- You would use a module in another module like so:

```python
from mypackage import module1
from mypackage.subpackage import submodule2 as sm2

module1.some_function()
sm2.some_other_function()
```

- Or, equivalently:

```python
import mypackage

mypackage.module1.some_function()
mypackage.subpackage.submodule1.some_other_function()
```

# Python packages

## What are packages?

- Packages are a way to distribute Python software.
- Packages can contain libraries (example: NumPy, SciPy...) or
  applications (example: Jupyter). Or sometimes both.
- Packages are a collection of modules.
- You can install packages, and use in your projects.

## An example package: NumPy

You would install NumPy like so:

```
pip install numpy
```

And then use it like so:

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
>>> samples = rng.normal(size=2500)
>>> samples
array([ 1.61380659,  1.21211191, -0.30766142, ...,  1.77788338,
       -3.08686752, -0.20901042])
```

(An example of generating normally distributed random numbers, from
<https://numpy.org/>.)

## Python Package Index (PyPI)

- For most common needs with Python, there's a really good chance
  someone already has created a solution and published it in Python
  Package Index, also known as PyPI (<https://pypi.org/>).

- PyPI is a large repository of Python packages.
  - "601,286 projects; 6,499,014 releases; 13,103,667 files; 893,449
     users" at the time of writing this.  That is huge!

## pip

- `pip` is a command-line tool used to install Python packages from
  PyPI.
  - (Also from other Python repositories, sometimes.)
- `pip` itself is hosted on PyPI: <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>
  - so you can `pip install --upgrade pip` when there are new `pip`
    releases on PyPI.

## conda

TODO

## More on Python packages

- All kinds of packages
  - A bit over 500,000 thousand projects!
  
Some are very broadly useful:

- Database connectivity, Web access, Lovely graphics

Some are very specific:
- There are about 220 packages for dealing with Illumina DNA
  Sequencers, and that's one specific brand of those instruments.
  

## Example - specific domains

- Want to do crystallography?  87 packages available.
- Do you like synchrotrons? 113 packages.
- Most things even vaguely "scientific" have multiple packages
  available; some may be useful to you.

## Numpy

Let's look more closely at a package
In the next video, a look at "NumPy".

Numerical algorithms for Python, lovingly hand tuned for speed, tested
by experts, and used by tons of people.

## Working with LIGO data
